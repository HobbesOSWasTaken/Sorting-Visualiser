# Sorting Visualizer
This application visualizes different sorting algorithms using OpenGL.
My main goal for this project was to learn various different sorting algorithms as well
as the basics of batch rendering in graphics programming.

## Building

  The application can be built with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/):
    
    mvn clean package
    
  The jar file will be available in the `./target` directory.
  
## Controls
  Everything within this application can be controlled via the onscreen GUI.
  However there are also various keybinds for those actions:
  
  <kbd>B</kbd> for bubble sort.
  
  <kbd>I</kbd> for selection sort.
  
  <kbd>Q</kbd> for quick sort.
  
  <kbd>M</kbd> for merge sort.
  
  <kbd>A</kbd> to randomise the data.
  
## Libraries

* [LWJGL 3](https://www.lwjgl.org/) (minimal OpenGL configuration)
* [JOML](https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML) (math library)
* [Dear ImGUI](https://github.com/SpaiR/imgui-java) (pure java binding of the C++ UI library)

## Credits

* [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu) for the idea from his project in JS

## Planned

  - [x] Add more complex algorithms 
  - [x] Abstract algorithm computation to be faster
